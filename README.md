## Detecting cyberattacks in network traffic data by using SPLUNK.
In this project, I use SPLUNK to analyse network traffic of a victim network under cyberattacks and write a technical report include a list of attacks, methods for identifying attacks, consequences of attacks, and the countermeasure to address each attack.

 Please find more detail in the report file.
